# Snake Game (Android Kotlin)

This is a modern take on the classic Snake game, crafted for Android using the Kotlin programming language. In this iconic arcade game, you guide a snake that grows longer as it consumes food. The aim is to collect as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

This is a simple UI I created for a Snake game, inspired by the version I remember playing on a classic Nokia phone. The game is developed for Android using the Kotlin programming language, bringing back the nostalgic feel of guiding a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions.

## Features

- Classic Snake mechanics.
- Simple, intuitive touch controls

## Technologies Used

- Android SDK: Provides the framework and tools for building Android apps

## How to Play

- Control the snake using the on-screen directional buttons.
- Eat the food (usually a dot or square) to make the snake grow longer.
- Avoid hitting the walls or running into your own tail.
